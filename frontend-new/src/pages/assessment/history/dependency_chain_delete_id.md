# Assessment Delete Dependency Chain

This document lists the key files involved in the assessment deletion flow.

## Files in Sequence ðŸ”—

1. `frontend/src/pages/assessment/history/page.tsx` - Contains delete button UI and confirmation modal
2. `frontend/src/api/assessment/index.ts` - API client that exports the assessmentApi.delete() method
3. `frontend/src/api/assessment/requests/delete/Request.ts` - Handles the API request for deleting an assessment
4. `backend/routes/assessment.js` - Backend route that handles the DELETE request 
5. `backend/controllers/assessment.js` - Controller that processes the delete request
6. `backend/models/assessment/Assessment.js` - Database model that performs the deletion operation
7. `frontend/src/pages/assessment/history/page.tsx` - Updates UI to remove deleted assessment

## Delete Process Flow

1. **User Initiates Delete**: User clicks the delete button on an assessment in the history page
2. **Confirmation Dialog**: User confirms deletion in browser dialog
3. **API Call**: Frontend makes DELETE request to the backend
4. **Database Operation**: Backend deletes the assessment record
5. **UI Update**: Frontend filters out the deleted assessment from the list

## Code Dependencies

### Frontend

- **History Page**: `frontend/src/pages/assessment/history/page.tsx`
  - Contains delete button UI and handler
  - Uses `assessmentApi.delete()` method
  - Updates local state after successful deletion

- **Assessment API**: `frontend/src/api/assessment/index.ts`
  - Needs to implement `delete(id: string)` method to make API call to backend
  - Should handle errors appropriately

### Backend

- **Assessment Controller**: Should implement DELETE endpoint
- **Database**: Should handle cascading deletion of related records if applicable

## Implementation Requirements

1. **API Method**: The frontend assumes `assessmentApi.delete(id)` exists
2. **Error Handling**: Frontend handles API errors with toast notifications
3. **Optimistic UI Update**: Frontend removes the assessment from state immediately, without waiting for page reload

## Security Considerations

1. **Authorization**: Backend must verify user is authorized to delete the assessment
2. **Validation**: Backend must validate the assessment ID
3. **Audit Trail**: Consider logging delete operations for compliance or recovery

## Testing Requirements

1. Test successful deletion flow
2. Test error handling when deletion fails
3. Test UI state after deletion
4. Test unauthorized deletion attempts
