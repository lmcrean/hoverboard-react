# Success Metrics and Validation Plan

This document outlines the key metrics for evaluating Tributary's success and the decision-making process at the end of the 6-month MVP phase.

## Success Metrics (Month 6)

| Metric | Minimum Threshold | Action if Met | Action if Not Met |
|--------|------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Monthly Active Users | 300+ | Continue development | Evaluate product-market fit |
| Ad Revenue | £5+/month | Scale cautiously | Pivot or sunset |
| User Retention | 30%+ weekly return | Invest in growth | Reassess value proposition |
| Premium Conversions | 5+ users | Scale premium features | Reconsider pricing model |

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### User Engagement KPIs

1. **User Acquisition Rate**
   - Target: 50+ new users per month by month 6
   - Measurement: New account creations
   - Importance: Indicates market interest and growth potential

2. **User Retention Rate**
   - Target: 30% weekly active users
   - Measurement: Return rate within 7 days
   - Importance: Demonstrates product value and stickiness

3. **Feature Usage**
   - Target: 80% of users saving 3+ jobs and tracking 5+ keywords
   - Measurement: Database metrics on core feature usage
   - Importance: Validates core value proposition

### Financial KPIs

1. **AdSense Revenue Growth**
   - Target: 20%+ month-over-month growth
   - Measurement: AdSense dashboard metrics
   - Importance: Path to sustainability without additional investment

2. **Cost per User**
   - Target: <£0.05 per active user
   - Measurement: AWS costs ÷ active users
   - Importance: Ensures scalability without exceeding budget

3. **Premium Conversion Rate**
   - Target: 2% of active users
   - Measurement: Premium subscriptions ÷ active users
   - Importance: Validates willingness to pay for enhanced features

## Data Collection Mechanisms

To accurately track these metrics, we'll implement:

1. **User Activity Logging**
   ```javascript
   async function logUserActivity(userId, action, metadata = {}) {
     await db.collection('user_activity').add({
       userId,
       action,
       metadata,
       timestamp: new Date()
     });
   }
   ```

2. **Usage Analytics Dashboard**
   - Deploy a simple CloudWatch dashboard
   - Track core metrics in real-time
   - Set up weekly email reports

3. **Cohort Analysis**
   - Group users by registration week
   - Track retention across cohorts
   - Identify patterns in feature adoption

## Validation Timeline

| Month | Focus | Key Metrics |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1-2 | Core functionality | AWS costs, basic usage |
| 3-4 | User acquisition | New users, retention rate |
| 5-6 | Monetization validation | AdSense revenue, premium conversions |

## Sunset Plan (If Product Fails to Gain Traction)

If the product fails to meet minimum success metrics by month 6:

1. **Notify Users**: Send email notification 30 days in advance of shutdown
   ```javascript
   async function sendSunsetNotification() {
     const users = await db.collection('users').get();
     for (const user of users.docs) {
       await sendEmail({
         to: user.data().email,
         subject: 'Important Notice: Tributary Service Update',
         body: `
           Dear ${user.data().name},
           
           We regret to inform you that Tributary will be shutting down on ${SUNSET_DATE}.
           
           You can export your data until that date by visiting your account settings.
           
           Thank you for being part of our journey.
           
           The Tributary Team
         `
       });
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Data Export**: Provide functionality for users to export their data
   ```javascript
   async function generateUserDataExport(userId) {
     const userData = {
       jobs: await db.collection('jobs').where('userId', '==', userId).get(),
       keywords: await db.collection('keywords').where('userId', '==', userId).get()
     };
     
     return {
       json: JSON.stringify(userData),
       csv: convertToCSV(userData)
     };
   }
   ```

3. **Resource Decommissioning**: Systematically shut down AWS resources
   ```javascript
   async function decommissionResources() {
     // Sequence matters to avoid orphaned resources
     await disableApiGateway();
     await setLambdaConcurrencyToZero();
     await backupFinalData();
     await deleteDynamoDBTables();
     await deleteS3Buckets();
     await deleteCloudWatchResources();
     await deleteIAMRoles();
   }
   ```

4. **Knowledge Capture**: Document learnings for future projects
   - Technical insights
   - User feedback analysis
   - Market observations
   - Cost analysis

## Pivot Options (If Needed)

If metrics suggest a pivot is needed, consider these alternatives:

1. **B2B Focus**: Pivot to serving recruiters/employers instead of job seekers
2. **Tool Specialization**: Focus on a specific high-value subset of features
3. **Integration Play**: Position as an add-on to existing job platforms
4. **Open Source**: Release as open source with optional hosted version
